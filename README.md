# Fisher Work

A set of fisher functions, and configuration settings that makes my software development process smoother.

## Requirements

Of course, you need the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

`fisher install github.com/darrensapalo/fisher-work`

This adds the set of functions that I use regularly on the fish shell.

## Command Line tools

### `work-submit`

This allows you to push the current branch to its corresponding branch (same name) on the remote repository.

### `git-ignore-fix`

This fixes your gitignore [when some files which should not be tracked are tracked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11451535/gitignore-is-ignored-by-git).
